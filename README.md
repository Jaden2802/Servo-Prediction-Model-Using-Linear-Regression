# Servo-Prediction-Model-Using-Linear-Regression

Servo prediction using linear regression aims to predict the behavior or position of a servo motor based on various input parameters. This kind of problem can be approached by applying machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
